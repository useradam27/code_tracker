# Code Productivity Tracker

This python script is a timer that is used to keep track of how long you are coding. It also allows you to easily log your coding session to your google calendar.

Note: credentials.json must be in the same directory as the script for personal use.  You can authorize your own credentials on the Google Cloud console.
